          <h2>Challenges in the Current System</h2>
          <p>India's rapidly growing digital payment economy has made transactions more seamless, but many individuals and small businesses still rely on verbal agreements or informal promises. This creates challenges such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Legal Protection:</strong> Individuals hesitate to lend money due to the fear of non-repayment, especially introverts who find it difficult to ask for their money back from friends, family, or acquaintances.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Risks:</strong> Small businesses struggle to recover payments for goods and services, and legal action is often complex, costly, and time-consuming.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Loopholes for Defaulters:</strong> Many defaulters exploit the legal system's inefficiencies, knowing that enforcing an informal agreement is difficult.</li>
          </ul>
